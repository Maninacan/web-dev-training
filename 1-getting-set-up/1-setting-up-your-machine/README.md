# Setting Up Your Machine

Before you can start creating web applications, you will need a number of tools to support you in your efforts:

- [ ] A text editor or IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) for writing your code.  Good text editors will help you write clean code by providing syntax highlighting and hints.
- [ ] A command line terminal to manipulate your files and directories. (That is an understatement. The command line is very powerful and will be your best friend throughout your career)
- [ ] Google Chrome web browser.  Even though you can do web development with any browser, I will assume that you are using Chrome which will be important as we learn how to use the development tools.
