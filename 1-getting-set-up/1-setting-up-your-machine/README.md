# Setting Up Your Machine

Before you can start creating web applications, you will need a number of tools to support you in your efforts:

- [ ] A text editor or IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) for writing your code.  Good text editors will help you write clean code by providing syntax highlighting and hints. Pick at least one from the list below.
- [ ] A command line terminal to manipulate your files and directories. (That is an understatement. The command line is very powerful and will be your best friend throughout your career).  Pick at least one from the list below.
- [ ] A web browser. The Google Chrome browser is recommended.  Even though you can do web development with any browser, I will assume that you are using Chrome which will be important as we learn how to use the browser's development tools.  Pick at least one from the list below.

## Text Editors

- [WebStorm by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - My personal preference but it does have a price

- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - A great editor and it's free

- [ATOM](https://atom.io/) - I know people really like it, but I already have my favorite

\* This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of text editors.  These are just my personal top 3.

## Command Line Options

### For Mac

- terminal - Go to 'Applications' -> 'Utilities' -> 'Terminal'

- [iTerm](http://iterm2.com/)

### For Windows

- [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

- [Git For Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)

## Browsers

From what I have seen, serious software developers typically stick with Chrome or Firefox as their personal browser favorite, but in a lot of ways it is really up to personal preference.

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

- Safari (Mac users only)

- Edge (Windows users only)
